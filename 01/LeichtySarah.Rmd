## Prompt:

During a class on modeling environmental systems, we were provided with an excel sheet with data on fish populations and their decline based on varying levels of salt in a lake where they were residing. , but I proceeded to make various new sheets within the workbook to separate different attempts at analyzing the data. This led to me being confused on which sheet had the correct equations that led to a better analysis, which resulted in hours of frustration and confusion. 

Talk about your worst experience with data. Try to think about what made this experience stand out in your mind and why it was so difficult. If you could have changed one or two things about the situation, what would you prioritize?
